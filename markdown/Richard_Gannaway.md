## DevOps Manager · Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Engineering

I am a DevOps Manager specializing in cloud infrastructure and platform engineering across AWS and Azure. I lead DevOps teams building and operating Terraform-based infrastructure, Kubernetes platforms, and secure delivery pipelines that enable product teams to move quickly and safely. I'm also an early adopter and advocate for the use of AI coding agents and other LLM based tooling to increase work output speed and quality. As an organizer of the DevOps 207 Meetup in Portland, ME, I am active in my local tech community and enjoy evangelizing DevOps principles and practices as well as helping others break into the field.

## Recent Work History

**DevOps Manager - Cloud Infrastructure (Jan 2024 - Present)**

I lead a team engineers that are responsible for implementing and maintaining AWS and Azure cloud infrastructure. We write and maintain Terraform infrastructure as code and apply platform engineering principles to deliver secure, scalable, self-service platforms for development teams. Our platform uses Kubernetes (Both AKS and EKS) and leverages cutting edge technology to provide fast and resilient operations to our development teams and customers. We use Kong Enterprise Gateway to manage ingress, Kong Service Mesh to manage internal traffic across clusters, and CloudFlare WAF to filter external traffic. We leverage Spot instancing (even in production!) to drastically reduce costs. We recently began migrating the companies largest PIMS platform, made up of 7000+ microservices, from Azure App Services to AKS. Our team heavily leverages GitHub Copilot to enhance the speed and quality of our work. 

**Senior DevOps Engineer and Scrum Master (2020 - Dec 2023)**

As the leader of a nine-member DevOps team, I work on Covetrus’ next generation practice management platform. I use Agile methodologies to assign and track tasks for my team, and ensure smooth collaboration with thirteen cross-functional software development teams. I also serve as a full time individual contributor, writing many of the terraform modules used for deploying and maintaining our cloud infrastructure in AWS, writing technical documentation, and provisioning CI/CD pipelines for new micro-services. I have also lead several major initiatives, such as migrating Confluent Kafka to private dedicated environments, migrating services from ECS to EKS and launching a new prescription management platform, which is now used by thousands of ventrinary practices.

BlueTarp Financial was acquired by CapitalOne; one month after CapitalOne suffered one of the largest security breaches in US history. At this time, I was the only engineer working in CyberSecurity for BlueTarp. I was responsible for auditing our systems and providing evidence for both federal investigators as well as CapitalOne's corporate cyber security teams. Based on findings from these audits, along with findings from bug bounty programs; I devised and executed on remediation projects to harden our systems.

**Information Security Engineer | Systems Engineer**  

At BlueTarp, I began as their sole Systems Engineer. Their internal IT Support team was preforming most of their responsibilities manually and their technical debt was threatening the continued operation of the company. After a year in this position, I had automated every aspect of workstation administration, implemented backup solutions, SAN and network appliances. I was then promoted to Information Security Engineer where I orchestrated IAM policies in GCP, wrote scripts to automate auditing GCP resources, hardened our PCI environment, oversaw penetration tests and conducted remediation efforts based on their findings.
