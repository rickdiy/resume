## DevOps and CyberSecurity Engineer

I am a DevOps and Cyber Security Engineer with a passion for automating processes using bash scripting and infrastructure as code. I have a broad knowledge of Cloud Infrastructure and Software Delivery technologies, such as Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Azure, Harness and more. I can also write clear and concise technical documentation to support your process improvement and automation goals. As an organizer of the DevOps 207 Meetup, I enjoy supporting my local IT community and evangelizing about DevOps principles.

## Recent Work History

### 2020 - Present
**Covetrus** - 12 Mountfort St. Portland, ME (Remote)  
**DevOps Manager - Cloud Infrastructure (Jan 2024 - Present)**  
Leading a team responsible for Covetrus' AWS and Azure cloud infrastructure. We write and maintain Terraform-based infrastructure as code and apply platform engineering principles to deliver secure, scalable, self-service platforms for development teams. Our platform resides primarily in Kubernetes (Both AKS and EKS) and leverages cutting edge technology to provide fast and resilient operations to our development teams and customers. We use Kong Enterprise Gateway to manage ingress, Kong Service Mesh to manage internal across clusters, and CloudFlare WAF to filter external traffic. We leverage Spot instancing (even in production!) to drastically reduce costs. Our team heavily leverages GitHub Copilot to enhance the speed and quality of our work. 

**Senior DevOps Engineer and Scrum Master (2020 - Dec 2023)**  
As the leader of a nine-member DevOps team, I work on Covetrus’ next generation practice management platform. I use Agile methodologies to assign and track tasks for my team, and ensure smooth collaboration with thirteen cross-functional software development teams. I also serve as a full time individual contributor, writing many of the terraform modules used for deploying and maintaining our cloud infrastructure in AWS, writing technical documentation, and provisioning CI/CD pipelines for new micro-services. I have also lead several major initiatives, such as migrating Confluent Kafka to private dedicated environments and migrating services from ECS to EKS.

**CapitalOne** l One Monument Sq. Portland, ME (Partially Remote)  
**Senior Associate – Cyber Technical (Cyber Security Engineer)**  
BlueTarp Financial was acquired by CapitalOne; one month after CapitalOne suffered one of the largest financial security breaches in US history. At this time, I was the only engineer working in CyberSecurity for BlueTarp. I was responsible for auditing our systems and providing evidence for both federal investigators as well as CapitalOne's corporate cyber security teams. Based on findings from these audits, along with findings from bug bounty programs; I devised and executed on remediation projects to harden our systems.

### 2018 - 2019
**BlueTarp Financial** l One Monument Sq. Portland, ME  
**Information Security Engineer | Systems Engineer**  
At BlueTarp, I began as their sole Systems Engineer. Their internal IT Support team was preforming most of their responsibilities manually and their technical debt was threatening the continued operation of the company. After a year in this position, I had automated every aspect of workstation administration, implemented backup solutions, SAN and network appliances. I was then promoted to Information Security Engineer where I orchestrated IAM policies in GCP, wrote scripts to automate auditing GCP resources, hardened our PCI environment, oversaw penetration tests and conducted remediation efforts based on their findings.

**IT Support Specialist | Executive Support**  
While working at Vets First Choice, I provided 24/7 technical support and white glove service to executives and board members.
