## DevOps and CyberSecurity Engineer

I am a DevOps and Cyber Security Engineer with a passion for automating processes using bash scripting and infrastructure as code. I have a broad knowledge of Cloud Infrastructure and Software Delivery technologies, such as Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Harness and more. I can also write clear and concise technical documentation to support your process improvement and automation goals. As an organizer of the DevOps 207 Meetup, I enjoy supporting my local IT community and evangelizing about DevOps principles.
