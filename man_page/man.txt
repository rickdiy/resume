WORK HISTORY
       Covetrus (2020 - Present)
              Senior DevOps Engineer and Scrum Master

              As the leader of a nine-member DevOps team, I work on Covetrus’ next generation practice management platform. 
              I use Agile methodologies to assign and track tasks for my team, and ensure smooth collaboration with thirteen 
              cross-functional software development teams. I also serve as a full time individual contributor, writing many 
              of the terraform modules used for deploying and maintaining our cloud infrastructure in AWS, writing technical 
              documentation, and provisioning CI/CD pipelines for new micro-services.  I have also lead several major initiatives,
              such as migrating Confluent Kafka to private dedicated environments and migrating services from ECS to EKS.

       CapitalOne (2019 - 2020)
              Senior Associate – Cyber Technical. 
              
              BlueTarp Financial was acquired by CapitalOne; one month after CapitalOne suffered one of the largest financial security 
              breaches in US history. At this time, I was the only engineer working in CyberSecurity for BlueTarp. I was responsible for 
              auditing our systems and providing evidence for both federal investigators as well as CapitalOne's corporate cyber security teams. 
              Based on findings from these audits, along with findings from bug bounty programs; I devised and executed on remediation 
              projects to harden our systems.

       BlueTarp Financial (2018 - 2019)
              Information Security Engineer | Systems Engineer

              At BlueTarp, I began as their sole Systems Engineer. Their internal IT Support team was preforming most of their responsibilities 
              manually and their technical debt was threatening the continued operation of the company.  After a year in this position, I had automated 
              every aspect of workstation administration, implemented backup solutions, SAN and network appliances. I was then promoted to Information 
              Security Engineer where I orchestrated IAM policies in GCP, wrote scripts to automate auditing GCP resources, hardened our PCI environment, 
              oversaw penetration tests and conducted remediation efforts based on their findings.
