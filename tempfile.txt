## DevOps Manager · Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Engineering

I am a DevOps Manager specializing in cloud infrastructure and platform engineering across AWS and Azure. I lead DevOps teams building and operating Terraform-based infrastructure, Kubernetes platforms, and secure delivery pipelines that enable product teams to move quickly and safely. I enjoy leveraging automation, observability, and AI-powered tooling (LLMs, GitHub Copilot) to improve developer experience and reliability. As an organizer of the DevOps 207 Meetup in Portland, ME, I am active in my local IT community and enjoy evangelizing DevOps principles and practices.
